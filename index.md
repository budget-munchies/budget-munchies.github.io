# Budget Munchies
Wlecome to the Budget Munchies home page!

# Overview
This project offers a solution for college students on the hunt for recipes that are cheap, easy to make, and have limited ingredients. 
Users will be able to share recipes that have information such as cost per meal, appliances needed, dietary restrictions, time it takes to make, etc. 

Students will be able to search, browse, filter, and post recipes to the site. The recipes should at least include full ingredients list, appliance used, a picture of the finished meal, and the directions itself. 

# Mockups
### Mockup landing page
This is the original team favorite design of our landing page. Our team all created test landing page mockups and we went with this one for the design and color scheme.

### Alternative landing page
This is an alternative of the lading page. It looks similar to the original landing page with some tweaks. This was created after deciding the colors and design we wanted to follow.
