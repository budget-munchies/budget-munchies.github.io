## Overview
This project offers a solution for college students on the hunt for recipes that are cheap, easy to make, and have limited ingredients. 
Users will be able to share recipe that have information such as cost per meal, appliances needed, dietary restrictions, time it takes to make, etc. 

Students will be able to search, filter, and post recipes to the site. The recipes should at least include information on how and where to obtain the ingredients, a picture of the finished meal, and the directins itself. 

There will also be a vendor section where food vendors can contribute ingredient availability and price.
